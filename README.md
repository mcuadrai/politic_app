# Political Test
  It is a mobile application to know the political ideologies of who takes the test.

## How does it work

  There are only six questions with their respective alternatives. The alternatives are defined according to the type of ideology, be it communist, socialist, minarchist, and anarchocapitalist. The final result is the percentage according to political ideology.
  The alternatives that are presented in each question have different degrees in which the State can control or not. The more control the State has, the closer it is to communism, and the opposite is, the less influence of the State, then there is more individual freedom and there will be an approach to anarchocapitalism.
